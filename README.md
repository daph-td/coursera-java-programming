# Week 1
### 1. Intro to the course
#### Overview 7 steps process to approach any programming problem
1. Work example by hand
2. Write down what you did
3. Find patterns
4. Check by hand
5. Translate to code
6. Run test cases
7. Debug failed test cases

#### Real problems involved are:
- Analyzing DNA
- Manipulating CSV file
- Processing images

### 2. Getting started with BlueJ
#### Why Java?
- Popular and widely used
- Foundation of Android
- Can use to develop mobile and web apps

### 3. Variables and Mathematical operators
#### Shapes: collections of points
- Shapes (aka polygons) are collections of points
    - Triangle is a collection of 3 points
    - Circles and other shapes aren't a finite collection of points
- How do we construct a shape?
    - Shapes are constructed by adding one point at a time
- How do we access points in a shape?
- What operations/methods can we implement?

#### Semantics
- Get to know Java classes ie. Shape and point
    - What can these classes do?
    - How would you understand what this code does?
        - Need to know **semantics** of code ie. **meaning** of code
#### Variables
#### Mathematical operators
